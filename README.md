This project is a high-performance implementation of a Continuous Cellular Automata explorer, written in modern C++ and accelerated on the GPU using OpenCL. It is a real-time, interactive laboratory for discovering complex, life-like behaviors that emerge from simple, continuous rules.

## Inspiration

This work is a tribute to and a C++/OpenCL replica of the concepts explored by the YouTuber and programmer **[Emergent Garden](https://www.youtube.com/@EmergentGarden)**. His channel is a fascinating journey into **artificial life, artificial intelligence, emergence, and weird programs.**

While many of his incredible simulations are showcased in videos or run in the browser, this version was rebuilt from the ground up in C++20 and OpenCL. The goal was to create a native, high-performance tool to explore these "emergent gardens" on desktop hardware, allowing for larger simulations and deeper, interactive experimentation.

## Key Features

*   **GPU Acceleration:** The core simulation logic runs entirely on the GPU via an OpenCL kernel, enabling large grid sizes (1500x720) to be simulated at high, interactive frame rates.
*   **Interactive GUI:** Built with **Dear ImGui**, the interface is a control panel for reality, allowing real-time modification of all simulation parameters:
    *   A live editor for the convolution kernel with forced symmetry options.
    *   A color picker to change the aesthetic of the "living" cells.
    *   Buttons to instantly randomize the filter or reset the entire cellular universe.
*   **Live Kernel Compilation:** The automaton's "DNA"—its activation function, written in OpenCL C—can be edited directly within the GUI. A click on "Compile" launches a background thread to build the new code and inject it into the live simulation without freezing the user interface, allowing for seamless creative flow.
*   **Intuitive Exploration:** The simulation view can be panned and zoomed (`WASD` + Mouse Wheel), turning the user into a microscopic explorer discovering new lifeforms and patterns in their digital petri dish.

## Tech Stack

*   **Language:** C++20
*   **GPGPU Computing:** OpenCL
*   **Graphics & Windowing:** SFML 2.5.1
*   **Graphical User Interface:** Dear ImGui
*   **Build System:** CMake
*   **Dependency Management:** vcpkg

## Building the Project

This project uses CMake and vcpkg for a straightforward and reproducible build process.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using vcpkg:**
    `vcpkg` will automatically read the `vcpkg.json` manifest file and install the correct versions of SFML, ImGui, and OpenCL.
    ```bash
    # (Ensure vcpkg is installed and integrated with Visual Studio)
    # Visual Studio will handle this automatically when opening the project as a CMake folder.
    ```

3.  **Compile with CMake and Visual Studio:**
    *   Open the project folder in Visual Studio (`File > Open > Folder...`).
    *   Visual Studio will detect the `CMakeLists.txt` file and configure the project.
    *   Select the `CCA_Executable` as the startup target and build.

## Future Work

*   **FFT-based Fast Convolution:** Implement convolution in the frequency domain using `clFFT` to enable real-time simulation with much larger convolution kernels, allowing for more complex, long-range interactions.
*   **"DNA" Library:** Add a system to save, load, and share interesting activation functions and kernel configurations.
*   **Video Export:** Implement functionality to record and export the mesmerizing patterns generated by the simulation.
